    "1. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards and forwards (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). So, for example, the words \"level\", \"kayak\" and \"pop\" are all English palindromes, as are the phrases \"rats live on no evil star\" and \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\", provided we ignore the spaces and punctuation. Write a function called `is_palindrome`, which takes a string as its only argument, and returns a Boolean. Your function should return `True` if the argument is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. For the purposes of this problem, you may assume that the input is a string and will consist only of alphanumeric characters (i.e., the letters, either upper or lower case, and the digits 0 through 9) and spaces. Your function should ignore spaces and capitalization in assessing whether or not a string is a palindrome, so that `tacocat` and `T A C O cat` are both considered palindromes."

Your function should require a single traversal of the list, and inefficient solutions (i.e., ones that require more than one traversal) will not receive full credit. You may assume that all elements in the input sequence `seq` support the comparison operations (`==, </>, >=`, etc), so that there is no need for error checking. (Indeed, if you try to make the comparison, say, `1 < 'cat'`, Python will raise an error for you, anyway.) **Note:** this problem illustrates a particularly useful aspect of Python's dynamic typing.

Write a function called `binary_search` that takes two arguments, a list of integers `t` (which is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order) and an integer `elmt`, and returns `True` if `elmt` appears in list `t` and `False` otherwise. Of course, you could do this with the in operator, but that will be slow when the list is long, for reasons that we discussed in class. Instead, you should use *binary search*: To look for `elmt`, first look at the \"middle\" element of the list `t`. If it's a match, return `True`. If it isn't a match, compare `elmt` against the \"middle\" element, and recurse, searching the first or second half of the list depending on whether `elmt` is bigger or smaller than the middle element. **Hint:** be careful of the *base cases:* What should you do when `t` is empty, length 1, length 2, etc.? **Note:** your solution must actually make use of binary search to receive credit, and your solution must not use any built-in sorting or searching functions. **Note:** we could, if we wanted, use the function `is_sorted` that we wrote above to do error checking here, but there is a good reason not to do so. This reason will become clear when we make our brief foray into the topic of *runtime analysis* later in the semester."

    "2. In natural language processing and bioinformatics, we often want to count how often characters or groups of characters appear. Pairs of words or characters are called \"bigrams\". For our purposes in this problem, a bigram is a pair of characters. As an example, the string 'mississippi' contains the following bigrams, in order: <center>`'mi', 'is', 'ss', 'si', 'is', 'ss', 'si', 'ip', 'pp', 'pi'`</center> Write a function called `bigram_hist` that takes a string as its argument and returns a dictionary whose keys are 2-tuples of characters and values are the number of times that pair of characters appeared in the string. So, for example, when called on the string `'mississippi'`, your function should return a dictionary with keys <center>`'mi','is','ss','si','ip','pp','pi'`</center> and respective count values <center>1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1</center> As another example, if the two-character string `'ab'` occurred four times in the input, then your function should return a dictionary that includes the key-value pair `((a, b), 4)`. Your function should handle all characters (alphanumerics, spaces, punctuation, etc). So, for example, the string `'cat, dog'` includes the bigrams `'t,', ', '` and `' d'`. As in the previous subproblem, the dictionary produced by your function should only include pairs that actually appeared in the input, so that the absence of a given key implies that the corresponding two-character string did not appear in the input. Also as in the previous subproblem, you should count upper- and lower-case letters as the same, so that `'GA'` and `'ga'` both count for the same tuple, $(g, a)$."

That is, `vec_scalar_mult` implements multiplication of a vector by a scalar. Your function should check to make sure that the types of the input are appropriate (e.g., that `s` is a float or integer), and raise a `TypeError` with a suitable error message if the types are incorrect. However, your function should gracefully handle the case where the input s is an integer rather than a float, or the case where some or all of the entries of the input tuple are integers rather than floats. **Hint:** you may find it useful for this subproblem and the next few that follow it to implement a function that checks whether or not a given tuple is a \"valid\" vector (i.e., checks if a variable is a tuple and checks that its entries are all floats and/or integers)."

    "In the previous problem, you implemented matrix and vector operations using tuples to represent vectors. In many applications, it is common to have vectors of dimension in the thousands or millions, but in which only a small fraction of the entries are nonzero. Such vectors are called *sparse* vectors, and if we tried to represent them as tuples, we would be using thousands of entries just to store zeros, which would quickly get out of hand if we needed to store hundreds or thousands of such vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "A reasonable solution is to instead represent a sparse vector (or matrix) by only storing its non-zero entries, with (index, value) pairs. We will take this approach in this problem, and represent vectors as dictionaries with positive integer keys (so we index into our vectors starting from 1, just like in MATLAB and R). A *valid* sparse vector will be a dictionary that has the properties that (1) all its indices are positive integers, and (2) all its values are floats.\n",
    "1. Write a function `is_valid_sparse_vector` that takes one argument, and returns `True` if and only if the input is a valid sparse vector, and returns `False` otherwise. **Note:** your function should *not* assume that the input is a dictionary."

    "\n",
    "**Note:** This may be your first foray into *algorithm design*, so here's something I'd like you to think about: there are several distinct ways to perform this inner product operation, depending on how one chooses to iterate over the entries of the two dictionaries. For this specific problem, it doesn't much matter which you choose, but there is an important point that you should consider: if the indices of our vectors were sorted, there would be an especially fast way to perform this operation that would require that we look at each entry of the two vectors at most once. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee about order of dictionary keys, so we can't take advantage of this fact, but we'll come back to it. You **do not** need to write anything about this, but please give it some thought."

Letting $n$ be the integer given in the input, your function should return a tuple of the same length as the input tuple, but with its entries \"rotated\" by $n$. If $n$ is positive, this should mean to \"push forward\" all the entries of the input tuple by $n$ entries, with entries that \"go off the end\" of the tuple being wrapped around to the beginning, so that the $i$-th entry of the input tuple becomes the $(i + n)$-th entry of the output, wrapping around to the beginning of the tuple if this index goes off the end. If $n$ is negative, then this corresponds to rotating the entries in the other direction, with entries of the input tuple being \"pushed backward\". Your function should perform error checking to ensure that the inputs are of appropriate types. If the user supplies a non-integer, print a message to alert the user that the input was not as expected, and try to recover by casting it to an integer. **Hint:** a try/catch statement will likely be useful here."

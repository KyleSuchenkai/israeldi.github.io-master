    "In this exercise, you’ll get some practice working with iterators and generators. **Note:** in this problem, the word *enumerate* is meant in the sense of returning elements, not in the sense of the Python function `enumerate`. So, if I say that an iterator enumerates a sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\\dots,$ I mean that these are the elements that it returns upon calls to the `__next__` method, *not* that it returns pairs $(i,a_i)$ like the `enumerate` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a class `Fibo` of iterators that enumerate the Fibonacci numbers. For the purposes of this problem, the Fibonacci sequence begins $0,1,1,2,3,\\dots,$ with the $n$-th Fibonacci number $F_n$ given by the recursive formula $F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$. Your solution should not make use of any function aside from addition (i.e., you should not need to use the function `fibo()` defined in lecture a few weeks ago). Your class should support, at a minimum, an initialization method, a `__iter__` method (so that we can get an iterator) and a `__next__` method. **Note:** there is an especially simple solution to this problem that can be expressed in just a few lines using tuple assignment."

    "2. We can generalize the Fibonacci sequence by following the same recursive procedure $F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$, but using a different choice of initial two values for $F_0$ and $F_1$. For example, if we take $F_0 = 2$ and $F_1 = 1$, then we obtain the Lucas numbers, which are closely related to the Fibonacci numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number ). Define a class `GenFibo` of iterators that enumerate *generalized* Fibonacci numbers. Your class should inherit from the `Fibo` class defined in the previous subproblem. The initialization method for the `GenFibo` class should take two *optional* arguments that specify the values of $F_0$ and $F_1$, in that order, and their values should default so that `F = GenFibo()` results in an enumerator equivalent to the one that would have been created if you had called `F = Fibo()` (i.e., `GenFibo()` should produce an iterator over the Fibonacci numbers)."

    "4. This one is good practice for coding interview questions. The *Ulam numbers* are a sequence $u_1, u_2, u_3,\\dots$ of positive integers, defined in the following way: $u_1 = 1$, and $u_2 = 2$. For all $n > 2$, $u_n$ is the smallest integer that is expressible as a sum of two *distinct* terms from earlier in the sequence in *exactly one way*. See the Examples section of the Wikipedia page for an illustration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_number . Define a generator `ulam` that enumerates the Ulam numbers. **Hint:** it will be helpful to try and break this problem into smaller, simpler subproblems. In particular, you may find it helpful to write a function that takes a list of integers `t` and one additional integer `u`, and determines whether or not `u` is expressible as a sum of two distinct elements of `t` in exactly one way."

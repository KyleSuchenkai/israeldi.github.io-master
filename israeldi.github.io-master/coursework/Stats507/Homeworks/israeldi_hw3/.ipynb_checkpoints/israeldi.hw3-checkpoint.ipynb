    "In your previous homework, you wrote a function for counting character bigrams. Now,\n",
    "let's write a function for counting word bigrams. That is, for each pair of words, say,\n",
    "`cat` and `dog`, we want to count how many times the word \"cat\" occurred immediately\n",
    "before the word \"dog\". We will represent this bigram by a tuple, `('cat', 'dog')`. For\n",
    "our purposes, we will ignore all spaces, newlines, punctuation and capitalization in our\n",
    "counting. So, as an example, the fragment of poem,\n",
    "\n",
    "    Half a league, half a league,\n",
    "    Half a league onward,\n",
    "    All in the valley of Death\n",
    "    Rode the six hundred.\n",
    "\n",
    "includes the bigrams `('half', 'a')` and `('a', 'league')` both three times, the bigram\n",
    "`('league', 'half')` appears twice,while the bigram `('in', 'the')` appears only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `count_bigrams_in_file` that takes a filename as its only argument. Your function should read from the given file, and return a dictionary whose keys are bigrams (given in the tuple form above), and values are the counts for those bigrams. Again, your function should ignore punctuation, spaces, newlines and capitalization. The strings in your key tuples should be lower-case. Your function should use a try-catch statement to raise an error with an appropriate message to alert the user in the event that the given file cannot be opened, and a different error in the event that the provided argument isn't a string at all. **Hint:** you will find the Python function `str.strip()`, along with the string constants defined in the string documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html ), useful in removing punctuation. **Hint:** be careful to check that your function handles newlines correctly. For example, in the poem above, one of the `('league', 'half')` bigrams spans a newline, but should be counted nonetheless. **Note:** be careful that your function does not accidentally count the empty string as a word (this is a common bug if you aren't careful about splitting the input text). Solutions that merely delete \"bad\" keys from the dictionary at the end will not receive full credit, as all edge cases can handled by correctly splitting the input."

    "3. We say that word A is *collocated* with word B in a text if words A and B occur immediately one after another (in either order). That is, words A and B are collocated if and only if either of the tuples `(A, B)` or `(B, A)` are present in the text. Write a function `collocations` that takes a filename as its only argument and returns a dictionary. Your function should read from the given file (raising an appropriate error if the file cannot be opened or if the argument isn't a string at all) and return a dictionary whose keys are all the strings appearing in the file (again ignoring case and stripping away all spaces, newlines and punctuation) and the value of word A is a Python set containing all the words collocated with A. Again using the poem fragment above as an example, the string `'league'` should appear as a key, and should have as its value the set `{'a', 'half', 'onward'}`, while the string `'in'` should have the set `{'all', 'the'}` as its value. **Hint:** we didn't discuss Python sets in lecture, because they are essentially just dictionaries without values. See the documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets for more information."

The initializer for your class should take the dimension as its first argument and a list or tuple of numbers (ints or floats), representing the vector's entries, as its second argument. Choose sensible default behavior for the case where the user applies only a dimension and no entries.

We will say that two `Vector` objects are equivalent if they have the same coordinates. Otherwise, comparison should be analogous to tuples in Python, so that comparison is done on the first coordinate first, then the second coordinate, then the third, and so on. So, for example, the two-dimensional vector (2, 4) is ordered before (less than) (2, 5). Attempting to compare two vectors of different dimensions should result in an error."

Left- or right- multiplication by a scalar, e.g., `2*v` or `v*2`, where `v` is a `Vector` object, should result in a new `Vector` object with its entries all scaled by the given scalar. We will also follow `R` and `numpy` (which you will learn in a few weeks), and use * to denote entrywise vector-vector multiplication, so that for `Vector` objects `v` and `w`, `v*w` results in a new `Vector` object, with the $i$-th entry of `v*w` equal to the $i$-th entry of `v` multiplied by the $i$-th entry of `w`. Implement the appropriate operators to support this multiplication operation. Many languages have a convention for dealing with multiplication of vectors that differ in their dimension, but we will punt on this matter. Your method should raise an appropriate error in the event that v and w disagree in their dimensions."

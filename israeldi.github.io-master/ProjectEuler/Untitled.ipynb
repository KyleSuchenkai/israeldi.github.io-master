    "What follows are Python-based solutions to Project Euler problems. In writing the code, I have aimed for a balance between readability and being concise, for which Python is well-suited. Efficiency is only considered if necessary to get reasonable runtime. To check your answers, create an account on Project Euler, where you can submit answers for validation and track your progress."
